# What is a deck

## Topics

- Design using sealed hierachies and data classes
- Using optics to access JSON

## Tasks

- [ ] Improve the hierarchy by making a Type only available in a Pokémon or a Basic Energy
- [ ] Improve the hierarchy by distinguishing types available to Pokémon, and those available as energy types (no dragon), and separate colorless
- [ ] Add information about evolution to Stage 1 and Stage 2
  - This requires using optics, since the implementation uses those
