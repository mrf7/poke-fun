Compose App for building decks
- Use of Raise and Ior
  - Card not found => Left
  - More than 4 of something => Both
  - [(Identifier, Number)] -> Ior<NonEmptyList<Problem>, Deck>
- We use pokemon-tcg-data service to search
  - Apply resilience there (retry, circuit breaker)
  - Parse JSON using optics (instead of plain deserialization)
- Designing a good API for your ViewModel
  - Use optics-compose to provide a view over parts of it (?)
  - Use Molecule to test (maybe also speak about injecting there?)
- Keeping all the resources correctly
  - Resource / SuspendApp for HttpClient and others
- Computing statistics in one go => Collectors
