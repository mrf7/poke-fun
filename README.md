# PokÃ©-Fun with Kotlin and Arrow

> Learn functional programming principles in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), using [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/).

The book is being developed using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) with the [admonish](https://github.com/tommilligan/mdbook-admonish) and [mermaid](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-mermaid) plug-ins. Until we set up the proper workflow to publish the book, you can also [read it in GitHub](./guide/SUMMARY.md).
