# To-do's

We expect to improve the code as some of the technology progresses:

- Move the font to resources once [supported in Amper](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/AMPER-555)
- Move the Jetpack's `ViewModel` once it fully supports Multiplatform, instead of [JetBrains'](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-viewmodel.html#adding-the-common-viewmodel-to-your-project)
- Move to Ktor 3.0 once it works with Kamel
